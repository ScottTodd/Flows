## Summary
Based loosely on the theme of *Change*, Flows is a game about *changing* the flow of particles in the stage. To complete each level, you must position the pushers and splitters provided in such a way that each flow reaches the sink of the same color.

Best viewed in Google Chrome, also tested in Mozilla Firefox.
